# Netflix Frontend Clone

A simple **Netflix landing page and login page clone** built using **HTML and CSS only**.  
This was my **first frontend project**, created to learn webpage structuring, styling, and responsive layout techniques.  
The UI is designed to look very close to the original Netflix website.
